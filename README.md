# template_engine

This assignment uses the node.js program to create a template generator for README.md files. This application is useful for quickly creating markdown files that can be easily customized by the user for quick and accurate explanations of what the user has created. This tool is valuable in saving time as well as keeping consistent markdown files. The application is initiated by the command line and will prompt the user to input specifics about his/her project. After all inputs are sent in, the generator will automatically create a markdown file. This application requires node.js to function. Sample.md was created using this application.
